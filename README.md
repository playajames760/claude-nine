# Claude Nine Framework 🚀

**A systematic framework for AI-dependent application development using Claude Code**

Claude Nine is a structured prompt library designed to enable completely AI-driven development workflows. This framework provides systematic approaches to feature implementation, codebase maintenance, and quality assurance through organized prompt patterns and validation methodologies.

## Framework Philosophy

This framework is built around the principle of **systematic AI collaboration** where:
- AI handles implementation while following structured prompts
- Validation occurs through AI-driven testing and verification
- Context management ensures continuity across development sessions
- Maintenance routines keep codebases clean and well-documented

```

## Core Workflow

### 1. Session Initialization
```bash
# Start with framework activation
/claude-nine-prompt

# Load project context
# Framework automatically reads CLAUDE.md for project-specific guidance
```

### 2. Feature Development Cycle
```bash
# Plan feature architecture
/feature-architect "user authentication system"

# Implement systematically  
/implementation-guide

# Validate integration
/integration-validator

# Update context
/context-manager --update-feature "authentication"
```

### 3. Maintenance Cycle (Periodic)
```bash
# Clean and optimize CLAUDE.md
/context-cleanup

# Audit dependencies and security
/dependency-audit
/security-audit

# Validate overall codebase health
/codebase-health
```

## Key Framework Features

### 🎯 **Systematic Development**
- Structured prompts guide AI through complex implementations
- Consistent patterns ensure reliable outcomes
- Built-in validation at each development stage

### 🧠 **Context Management**
- Automatic CLAUDE.md maintenance and optimization
- Session continuity across development cycles
- Project memory that evolves with codebase

### 🔍 **AI-Driven Validation**
- Testing frameworks designed for AI implementation
- Automated quality checks and security audits
- Integration verification between system components

### 🔄 **Maintenance Workflows**
- Periodic cleanup routines for context and dependencies
- Health monitoring for long-running projects
- Systematic technical debt management

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/playajames760/claude-nine.git
cd claude-nine

# Run interactive installer
./install.sh

# Choose "Framework Mode" for AI-dependent development
```

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize your project:**
   ```bash
   cd your-project
   claude
   /claude-nine-prompt
   ```

2. **Create project context:**
   ```bash
   # Framework will guide you through CLAUDE.md setup
   /context-manager --initialize
   ```

3. **Start developing:**
   ```bash
   /feature-architect "describe your feature"
   ```

## Framework Prompts

### Core Framework
- `/claude-nine-prompt` - Initialize framework in current session
- `/context-manager` - Manage CLAUDE.md and project context
- `/validation-framework` - Set up AI-driven testing patterns

### Development Workflows  
- `/feature-architect` - Plan and design new features
- `/implementation-guide` - Systematic feature implementation
- `/integration-validator` - Verify component integration
- `/code-review` - AI-driven code quality review

### Maintenance Routines
- `/context-cleanup` - Optimize CLAUDE.md for clarity and relevance
- `/dependency-audit` - Review and update project dependencies
- `/codebase-health` - Comprehensive codebase health assessment
- `/security-audit` - Security vulnerability scanning and fixes

### Quality Assurance
- `/testing-framework` - Comprehensive testing implementation
- `/performance-audit` - Performance optimization analysis
- `/technical-debt` - Identify and address technical debt

## Best Practices

### Context Management
- Run `/context-cleanup` weekly to maintain CLAUDE.md quality
- Update context after major feature implementations
- Keep project-specific patterns and preferences documented

### Development Workflow
- Always start sessions with `/claude-nine-prompt`
- Use `/feature-architect` before implementing complex features
- Validate integrations with `/integration-validator`

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Daily**: Context updates after development sessions
- **Weekly**: Dependency audits and context cleanup
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive health checks and security audits

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflow Integration
The framework supports extending prompts for project-specific needs:

```markdown
# In your CLAUDE.md
## Custom Workflows
- `/my-api-pattern` - Custom API development pattern
- `/my-testing-setup` - Project-specific testing configuration
```

### Multi-Agent Development
For complex projects, use multiple Claude sessions:
- Session 1: Feature development with framework prompts
- Session 2: Testing and validation
- Session 3: Documentation and maintenance

## Framework Philosophy

This framework operates on the principle that AI can handle the majority of software development tasks when given:
1. **Structured guidance** through systematic prompts
2. **Proper context** through maintained CLAUDE.md files
3. **Validation patterns** through AI-driven testing
4. **Maintenance routines** to keep everything current

The goal is to enable developers to focus on architecture and requirements while AI handles implementation details.

## Contributing

This framework evolves based on real-world AI development patterns. Contributions should focus on:
- Systematic prompt patterns that improve AI development outcomes
- Validation methodologies for AI-generated code
- Context management strategies for long-running projects
- Maintenance routines that keep codebases healthy
