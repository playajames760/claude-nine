**First time here? Perfect!** Claude Nine might look like a lot of commands and features, but here's the secret: **you only need to know 3 things to get started.**

> 🌟 **The Golden Rule:** Start simple, build confidence, then explore more!

### 🎯 Your First 5 Minutes

1. **Start Claude Code** in your project directory:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. **Say hello to Claude Nine!** Try this first:
   ```
   Hi Claude! I just installed Claude Nine and I'm new to this. 
   Can you introduce yourself and help me understand what you can do for my coding projects?
   My name is [your name] and I'm working on [brief description of your project].
   ```

3. **That's it!** Claude will guide you from there.

### 🚀 Your Core Toolkit (Start Here!)

These 4 commands handle 90% of everyday coding tasks. Master these first:
