# Accuracy Synchronizer üéØ

## Purpose & Overview
Updates project documentation to match actual implementation state, ensuring specs stay accurate and reliable for team collaboration and future development.

**üéØ New to this?** Think of this like keeping your project's "instruction manual" up-to-date with what you've actually built. When code changes but docs don't, confusion follows!

## When to Run
**Use this command when:**
- ‚úÖ After running implementation validator (follow-up step)
- ‚úÖ After major development sessions (end-of-day cleanup)
- ‚úÖ When merging branches or pull requests (pre-merge requirement)
- ‚úÖ Before planning new features (to know current state)
- ‚úÖ Weekly maintenance (keep everything fresh)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Don't run this when:**
- ‚ùå No implementation changes have been made
- ‚ùå During active development (wait for stable state)
- ‚ùå Before running tests (sync after everything works)

## Step-by-Step Synchronization Process

### Step 1: Gather Validation Data
**Research phase - Collect current reality**

```bash
# REQUIRED: Get validation results first
/implementation-validator
cat .claude/validation_results.md

# REQUIRED: Check current package versions
echo "=== Current Package Versions ==="
for pkg in packages/@crumb/*/package.json; do
  echo "$(dirname $pkg): $(grep '\"version\"' $pkg)"
done

# REQUIRED: Get recent development history
echo "=== Recent Development ==="
git log --oneline -10 --grep="feat\|fix\|chore"

# OPTIONAL: Get test coverage if available
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=text-summary 2>/dev/null || echo "No test coverage available"
```

**Success Criteria**: You should have clear data on current versions, recent changes, and test status before proceeding.

### Step 2: Update Module Status
**Plan phase - Categorize current state**

**Use these EXACT status markers:**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fully implemented, tested, working in production
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (with known issues)** - Working but has documented problems  
- üöß **IN PROGRESS** - Partially implemented, actively being developed
- üöß **NOT STARTED** - No implementation exists yet
- üîß **NEEDS UPDATE** - Implementation differs significantly from spec
- ‚ùå **BROKEN** - Was working but now fails

**Template for each module:**
```markdown
### Module: @crumb/[name] [STATUS]

**Current Version**: [exact version from package.json]
**Last Updated**: [git log date for this module]
**Test Coverage**: [X% or "Not measured"]
**Dependencies**: [list current dependencies with versions]

**Implementation Status**:
- ‚úÖ [Specific completed feature with evidence]
- üöß [Specific in-progress feature with details]
- ‚ùå [Specific broken/missing feature]

**Known Issues**:
- [Issue description] - [GitHub issue # or commit reference]
- [Issue description] - [Link to solution or workaround]
```

### Step 3: Synchronize Critical Sections
**Implement phase - Update documentation systematically**

#### A. Package Versions Section
```bash
# Generate current versions automatically
echo "## Current Package Versions - Updated $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
for pkg in packages/@crumb/*/; do
  if [ -f "$pkg/package.json" ]; then
    name=$(grep '"name"' "$pkg/package.json" | cut -d'"' -f4)
    version=$(grep '"version"' "$pkg/package.json" | cut -d'"' -f4)
    echo "- **$name**: $version"
  fi
done
```

#### B. Dependencies Matrix
```bash
# Extract and format dependencies
echo "## Actual Dependencies Matrix"
for pkg in packages/@crumb/*/; do
  if [ -f "$pkg/package.json" ]; then
    echo "### $(basename $pkg)"
    echo "```json"
    grep -A20 '"dependencies"' "$pkg/package.json" | grep '":' | grep -v dependencies
    echo "```"
  fi
done
```

#### C. Integration Status Matrix
**Update based on actual testing results:**
```markdown
### Integration Status Matrix - Updated [DATE]

| From | To | Status | Test Evidence | Notes |
|------|-----|--------|---------------|-------|
| CLI | API | ‚úÖ Working | `npm test api-integration` passes | JWT auth configured |
| API | Storage | ‚úÖ Working | All CRUD endpoints tested | Supabase connected |
| Storage | Database | üîß Needs Update | Connection timeouts observed | Issue #123 |
| CLI | Storage | ‚ùå Not Direct | No direct tests exist | Must go via API |
```

### Step 4: Move Issues Between Tracking Sections
**Verify phase - Reorganize based on current state**

#### Current Critical Issues
**Only include issues actively blocking development:**
```markdown
### üî• Current Critical Issues

**[Issue Name]** - Priority: [High/Critical]
- **Impact**: [What this breaks or prevents]
- **Evidence**: [Error messages, failed tests, user reports]
- **Assigned**: [Who's working on it]
- **Timeline**: [Expected resolution]
- **Workaround**: [Temporary solution if available]
```

#### Recently Resolved
**Move completed items here with full details:**
```markdown
### ‚úÖ Recently Resolved - [Date Range]

**[Issue Name]** - RESOLVED [exact date]
- **Problem**: [Original description]
- **Root Cause**: [What actually caused it]
- **Solution**: [Specific steps taken]
- **Commit**: [full commit hash and message]
- **Impact**: [What this fixes/enables]
- **Verification**: [How we confirmed the fix]
```

#### Known Limitations
**Document accepted technical debt:**
```markdown
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

**[Limitation Name]**
- **Description**: [What doesn't work as expected]
- **Workaround**: [How users can avoid/work around it]
- **Plan**: [When/how this will be addressed]
- **Priority**: [Low/Medium - why this is acceptable for now]
```

## Quality Assurance & Verification

### Before Committing Changes
**MUST complete these verification steps:**

1. **Diff Review**: `git diff` - Review all changes for accuracy
2. **Link Verification**: Test that all referenced issues/commits exist
3. **Consistency Check**: Ensure status markers match across all sections
4. **Evidence Validation**: Confirm all claims have supporting evidence
5. **Format Check**: Verify markdown renders correctly

### Success Criteria Checklist
**All items must be ‚úÖ before considering sync complete:**

- [ ] All module versions match `package.json` exactly
- [ ] All status changes have supporting evidence (commits, tests, issues)
- [ ] No "TODO" or placeholder text remains
- [ ] All links to issues/commits are valid
- [ ] Integration matrix reflects actual test results
- [ ] Issue movements include resolution details
- [ ] Timestamps are current and accurate

## Automation & Efficiency

### Quick Sync Commands
```bash
# Full synchronization
/accuracy-synchronizer

# Version sync only (fastest)
/accuracy-synchronizer --versions-only

# Issue status sync only
/accuracy-synchronizer --issues-only

# Test coverage sync
/accuracy-synchronizer --coverage-only

# Verify sync accuracy
/accuracy-synchronizer --verify
```

### Spec Section Line References
**Know where to make updates:**
- **Lines 150-300**: Module implementation status
- **Lines 400-600**: API endpoints and integration
- **Lines 800-1000**: Current package versions
- **Lines 1100-1300**: Issue tracking sections
- **Lines 1400+**: Development logs and history

## Learning & Best Practices

### üéì Beginner Tips
- **Start small**: Sync one module at a time when learning
- **Use evidence**: Always include commit hashes, test results, or issue numbers
- **Be specific**: "Login broken" ‚Üí "JWT authentication fails with 401 error"
- **Date everything**: Future you will thank present you

### üöÄ Advanced Techniques
- **Batch updates**: Group related changes for cleaner commits
- **Cross-reference**: Link related issues and commits
- **Trend tracking**: Note patterns in what frequently gets out of sync
- **Automation**: Use git hooks to remind about sync after major changes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Don't delete history**: Move old items to archive sections
- **Don't sync during active development**: Wait for stable states
- **Don't make assumptions**: Verify every claim with evidence
- **Don't skip verification**: Always test links and references

**üéØ Remember**: The goal is accuracy, not perfection. Regular small syncs beat massive occasional updates. Your documentation should tell the truth about your code, not an idealized version!

**‚ö° Pro tip**: Set up a weekly reminder to run this - future developers (including yourself) will thank you for accurate, up-to-date documentation.
