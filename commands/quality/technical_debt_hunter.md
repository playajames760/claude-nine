# Technical Debt Hunter 🎯

**Hunt down and eliminate technical debt before it slows your team down!** ✨

Finally tackle that messy code you've been putting off! This tool helps you find, prioritize, and systematically fix technical debt so your codebase stays healthy and your team stays productive.

## What is this?

Technical debt is like clutter in your house - it starts small but eventually makes everything harder. This tool acts like a professional organizer for your code, helping you identify what needs cleaning and creating a plan to tackle it systematically.

**Think of it like:**
- 🏠 **Like a home inspector** - Finds problems before they become expensive disasters
- 🩺 **Like a health checkup** - Regular examination keeps your codebase healthy
- 📋 **Like a cleaning checklist** - Breaks overwhelming tasks into manageable steps
- 🚀 **Like decluttering** - Remove what slows you down, keep what makes you fast

**Zero guesswork. Zero overwhelming lists. Just clear priorities and actionable fixes!**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 Get Amazing Results
- **Be specific!** Instead of "fix all debt", say "reduce file complexity in the user authentication module"
- **Share context!** Tell Claude about your team size, deadlines, and business priorities
- **Ask follow-ups!** Get detailed refactoring plans: "break this into 3 manageable tasks"

### ⚡ Work Super Fast
- **Combine commands!** Use `/debt:scan-codebase` then `/debt:quick-wins` for immediate action
- **Use shortcuts!** Set up `/debt:daily-check` for regular health monitoring
- **Remember patterns!** Learn to spot debt early and address it immediately

### 🚀 Level Up Your Skills
- **Start small!** Fix one small area completely rather than touching everything
- **Practice regularly!** Make debt review part of your regular development routine
- **Experiment!** Try different refactoring approaches on non-critical code first
