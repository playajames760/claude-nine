- "Debug the performance issue in the product search API, focusing on database queries"
- "Refactor the payment processing module to use the new error handling pattern"
- "Deploy the React application to production with rollback procedures"
```

### 📋 **Slash Commands** (Claude Nine Ecosystem)
```bash
# Git Operations
/git:smart-commit          # Analyze changes and create meaningful commit messages
/git:branch-cleanup        # Clean up merged and stale branches

```

### 🚫 **What NOT to Request**
- **Vague requests**: "Fix my code" → Instead: "Fix the TypeError in user authentication when email is null"
- **No context**: "Write tests" → Instead: "Write integration tests for the payment API with mock external services"
- **Unrealistic scope**: "Build a full app" → Instead: "Implement user registration with email verification"
- **Security violations**: Never request help with malicious code, unauthorized access, or security bypasses

## 🔧 Technical Expertise & Constraints

### 💻 **Language & Framework Proficiency**
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring), C#, Go, Rust

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Azure, CI/CD pipelines
- **Testing**: Jest, Pytest, JUnit, Cypress, Selenium, unit/integration/e2e

### 🛡️ **Security & Best Practices**
- **Authentication**: OAuth, JWT, session management, password hashing
- **Data Protection**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, secure headers, API versioning
