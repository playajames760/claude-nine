# CLAUDE.md Migrator 🔄

**Seamlessly migrate any specification file to CLAUDE.md format with full reference tracking** ✨

Perfect for projects switching to Claude Nine framework or consolidating existing documentation into the standardized CLAUDE.md format that Claude Code recognizes and prioritizes.

> 🎯 **Perfect for**: Teams adopting Claude Nine, projects with scattered specs, developers wanting Claude Code optimization

## What is this?

Ever had a project with SPEC.md, requirements.md, or design.md files scattered around? This tool consolidates everything into the CLAUDE.md format that Claude Code automatically reads and uses for context.

**Think of it like:**
- 🏠 **Moving houses** - Packing everything important and setting it up perfectly in your new home
- 📚 **Library reorganization** - Taking books from different shelves and creating one master reference
- 🗺️ **GPS update** - Ensuring all roads lead to the right destination after construction
- 🚀 **Mission control** - One central command center instead of multiple scattered control rooms

**Zero broken links. Zero lost content. Just seamless CLAUDE.md integration!**

## 🎨 Real Examples

### Scenario 1 - Simple SPEC.md Migration
```
# Step 1: Create backup and migrate main spec file
/claude-migrator:backup-and-migrate "SPEC.md"

# Step 2: Verify all references were updated correctly  
/claude-migrator:verify-all-references

# Expected outcome: 
# - SPEC.md copied to CLAUDE.md
# - All README.md, docs/*.md files now reference CLAUDE.md
# - Original SPEC.md backed up with timestamp
# - Project builds and links work correctly
```

### Scenario 2 - Multiple Specification Files  
```
# Step 1: See what specification files exist
/claude-migrator:scan-project

# Step 2: Consolidate all spec files into organized CLAUDE.md
/claude-migrator:consolidate-specs "SPEC.md,requirements.md,design.md"

# Step 3: Verify everything works
/claude-migrator:verify-all-references

# Expected outcome:
# - Single CLAUDE.md with sections: Overview, Requirements, Technical Spec, Design
# - All cross-references updated throughout project
# - Backup folder created with original files
# - No broken links or missing content
```

### Scenario 3 - First-Time Migration Learning
```
# Step 1: Understand your current project structure
/claude-migrator:scan-project

# Step 2: Learn what the migration will do
/claude-migrator:explain-benefits "SPEC.md"

# Step 3: Safely migrate with full backups
/claude-migrator:backup-and-migrate "SPEC.md"

# Expected outcome:
# - Clear understanding of your project's current spec files
# - Knowledge of what CLAUDE.md format provides
# - Successful migration with safety nets in place
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

### 🌱 Just Starting Out? Begin Here!
1. **scan-project** - See what specification files you have first
2. **backup** - Always create safety backups before changes
3. **simple-rename** - Start with basic single-file migration

**Why start here?** Understanding your current setup prevents surprises and ensures safety.

### 🚀 Getting Comfortable? Try These Next!
1. **migrate-spec** - Handle the most common migration scenario  
2. **update-references** - Learn how cross-project linking works
3. **verify-migration** - Build confidence in your migration results

**Why these next?** These cover 90% of migration scenarios and teach core concepts.

### 🏆 Ready to Level Up? Master Mode!
1. **consolidate-all** - Handle complex multi-file scenarios
2. **custom-consolidation** - Create sophisticated document structures
3. **enterprise-migration** - Plan organization-wide migrations

**Why save these for later?** These require understanding of project architecture and team workflows.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 Get Amazing Results
- **Be specific with filenames!** Use exact names: `/claude-migrator:migrate "SPEC.md"` not just "migrate spec"
- **Always backup first!** Every migration should start with backup creation
- **Verify everything!** Run verification commands after each migration step

### ⚡ Work Super Fast
- **Follow the sequence!** scan → backup → migrate → verify works every time
- **Use consolidation wisely!** List all files: `"SPEC.md,requirements.md,design.md"`
- **Batch reference updates!** One command updates entire project automatically

### 🚀 Level Up Your Skills
- **Master single files first!** Successfully migrate SPEC.md before trying multi-file
- **Learn verification patterns!** Understand what successful migration looks like
- **Practice rollback!** Know how to use reset commands if something goes wrong

## 🔗 Works Great With

- **claude-nine-prompt** - Initialize framework after migration
- **context-manager** - Optimize your new CLAUDE.md structure  
- **codebase-chat** - Use migrated specs for better AI context
