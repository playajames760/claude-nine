## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 Get Amazing Results
- **Be specific!** Instead of "build a form", say "create a multi-step checkout form with validation and error handling"
- **Share context!** Tell Claude about your app's requirements, user base, and performance needs
- **Ask follow-ups!** Get detailed implementation guidance: "show me the TypeScript interfaces for this component"

### ⚡ Work Super Fast
- **Combine commands!** Use `/react:component-generator` then `/react:performance-optimize` for production-ready components
- **Use shortcuts!** Set up component templates and reusable patterns
- **Remember patterns!** Learn common React patterns that solve frequent problems

### 🚀 Level Up Your Skills
- **Start small!** Build one perfect component rather than rushing through many
- **Practice regularly!** Experiment with new React features in side projects
- **Experiment!** Try different approaches to the same problem to understand trade-offs
