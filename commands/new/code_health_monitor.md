# Code Health Monitor 🩺

**Keep your codebase healthy with continuous quality tracking and early warning systems!** ✨

Like a fitness tracker for your code! Monitor quality metrics, catch problems early, and maintain healthy development habits that keep your project running smoothly.

> 🎯 **Perfect for**: Teams tracking code quality over time, developers wanting to prevent technical debt, anyone maintaining long-term projects

## What is this?

Code health monitoring is like having a personal trainer for your codebase. It watches for warning signs, tracks improvement trends, and alerts you before small issues become big problems.

**Think of it like:**
- 💪 **Like a fitness tracker** - Monitors vital signs and tracks progress over time
- 🚨 **Like a smoke detector** - Early warning system before problems become fires
- 📊 **Like a dashboard** - See all important metrics at a glance
- 🎯 **Like a coach** - Guides you toward better habits and practices

**Zero manual checking. Zero surprise failures. Just continuous visibility into your code's health!**

3. **Strategic Planning** - Align quality goals with business objectives

**Why save these for later?** These require deep understanding of both your codebase and team dynamics.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 Get Amazing Results
- **Be specific!** Instead of "improve quality", say "reduce cyclomatic complexity in payment processing modules"
- **Share context!** Tell Claude about your team's quality pain points and goals
- **Ask follow-ups!** Get detailed improvement plans: "what's the fastest way to improve this metric?"

### ⚡ Work Super Fast
- **Combine commands!** Use `/health:daily-checkup` then `/health:improvement-suggestions` for actionable insights
- **Use shortcuts!** Set up automated quality gates in your CI pipeline
- **Remember patterns!** Learn to recognize quality trends that predict problems

### 🚀 Level Up Your Skills
- **Start small!** Focus on one key metric rather than trying to track everything
